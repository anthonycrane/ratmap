#RATMAP

Ratmap is an interactive map that allows exploration of recent rat sightings in NYC! The data is accessed from NYC's DEP 311 Database, via Socrata's [Open Data Platform](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Social-Services/Rat-Sightings/3q43-55fe). The database is updated regularly, so you're always seeing the latest sightings.

### Contributing

I started Ratmap just for fun and was surprised when it saw a lot of interest on HackerNews and Twitter. You're more than welcome to contribute, no matter your skill level with Angular and Leaflet. Have an idea? Run it by me! I'd love to see your pull request.
